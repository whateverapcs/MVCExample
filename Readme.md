### MVC Example With Messaging

WIKI HAS A PIPEDREAM TO-DO LIST


This is a Java application program with a simple User Interface (UI) that 
demonstrates the concepts of Model-View-Controller (MVC) programming.  This
involves separating the Model (application data), the View (UI) and the
Controller into separate classes.  Each class should operate without needing to 
know the logic, structure, and programming of the other classes.  The only
thing each class is permitted to do is send and receive messages to communicate
with the other classes.

MVC is an extremely popular programming pattern and is suitable for 
all computer languages.  Once you learn the MVC pattern, you'll be able to
more easily understand programs that follow the same structure in other
languages.  

It will be fun!!
